    <h1>The One Girl I Pursued</h1>

  <hr> 
  
    <p>
        I saw her first across the night, <br>
        A spark of hope, a fleeting sight. <br>
        Her gaze, a world I couldn’t deny, <br>
        A silent promise beneath the sky.
    </p>
  
  <hr>
  
    <p>
        I followed trails that she had tread, <br>
        Each word she spoke stayed in my head. <br>
        Through whispers soft and moments few, <br>
        I knew my heart would chase her too.
    </p>
  
  <hr>
  
    <p>
        I braved the storms, the quiet fear, <br>
        Believing love would draw me near. <br>
        And every smile that she would give, <br>
        Made me certain, love must live.
    </p>
  
  <hr>
  
    <p>
        She walked with grace, so unaware, <br>
        Of how my soul pursued her there. <br>
        I watched her dance in sunlit streams, <br>
        The one who lived inside my dreams.
    </p>
  
  <hr>
  
    <p>
        I wrote her name on stars above, <br>
        A whispered prayer, a vow of love. <br>
        With every step, I hoped she knew, <br>
        That all I did was to pursue.
    </p>
  
  <hr>
  
    <p>
        The days grew long, the nights stretched thin, <br>
        Yet still I fought to let love in. <br>
        Her laugh became the song I’d sing, <br>
        A beacon bright through everything.
    </p>
  
  <hr>
  
    <p>
        And when she smiled, the world was bright, <br>
        Her voice could turn the dark to light. <br>
        A simple glance, and I was through— <br>
        Forever bound to her I knew.
    </p>
  
  <hr>

    <p>
        Now here we stand, no more to chase, <br>
        She smiles at me with quiet grace. <br>
        The road was long, but dreams came true— <br>
        At last, I found the one I pursued.
    </p>
